## Scripts

- game-scripts includes an auto-playing script for the first few levels of a
Arbcrgf game
- split\_chapters.py - searches an input file for a line that begins with
"CHAPTER", then splits the chapter into a separate file
- change\_punct.py - changes UTF-8 styled quotations into normal ones (also does
accents and whatnot)
- timezones.py - A timezone converter (it only works when DST is off unless you
add an hour to every value, or something -- I haven't used it in years)
