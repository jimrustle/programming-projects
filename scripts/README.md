## Scripts

- game-scripts includes an auto-playing script for the first few levels of a
Arbcrgf game

- 555timer.py - Script to select the value of resistors and capacitors for a
desired frequency or period, it's lacking features for high/low time output
- hangman.py - A simple hangman game
- split\_chapters.py - searches an input file for a line that begins with
"CHAPTER", then splits the chapter into a separate file
- change\_punct.py - changes UTF-8 styled quotations into normal ones (also does
accents and whatnot)
- steel.py - A very simple Runescape steel nail and superheating calculator
- timezones.py - A timezone converter (it only works when DST is off unless you
add an hour to every value)
- gasmileage.py - Script to convert gas mileages (it's probably not correct)
